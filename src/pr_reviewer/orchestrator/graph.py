"""Wires the four specialist agents and the aggregator into one LangGraph
graph. This is the only file that knows the topology - fan-out via Send,
join into aggregate. Every agent module only knows its own prompt; the
aggregator only knows how to merge Finding objects. Adding a 5th
specialist means adding one line to _AGENT_BUILDERS and nothing else.
